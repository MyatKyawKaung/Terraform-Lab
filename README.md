<h1 align="center">Automating Cloud Infrastructures using IaC</h1>

## Description

**Terraform** is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner, using a configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). This means you describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform automatically creates, modifies, or destroys the necessary resources to achieve that state. <br>

**_This project aims to learn the basics of Terraform and using it to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources._**

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
* Cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Terraform v1.9.5 or later
